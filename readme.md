4.6 Building the Complete System
To run the complete system, first clone the central Git repository at the following link: https://bitbucket.student.fiw.fhws.de:8443/scm/ppss25/gruppe-12—book-app.git
To fully run the system, two branches must be checked out separately: the main branch for the backend (Spring Boot) and the frontendapp branch for the Android application, which includes the user interface and the connection via Retrofit.
After successfully cloning the repository, the backend must be built with Maven. This is done by executing the mvn clean install command in the root directory of the backend project. This creates an executable JAR file in the target directory. To ensure a consistent and platform-independent runtime environment, the backend is run in a Docker container. The project includes a Dockerfile and a preconfigured docker-compose.yml file, which also includes the PostgreSQL database as a separate container.

Docker and Docker Compose must be installed locally before starting. The entire system can then be started using docker-compose up –build. The build process creates the Docker image for the backend, starts the container, and automatically connects to the database. The PostgreSQL instance is initialized with the database name bookapp, the user postgres, and the password postgres. Communication between the backend and the database occurs internally via the container name db, which is correctly stored in the SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL environment variable. The Spring Boot application listens on port 8080 by default after startup and is therefore accessible via http://localhost:8080.
The Android application automatically accesses the locally running backend via Retrofit without any additional configuration adjustments being necessary. The base URL in the application is set to localhost:8080, which establishes an immediate connection to the backend when the app starts. Please note that when developing or testing on real devices within the same network, the host's IP address may need to be specified instead of localhost.
In summary, the combination of Maven, Docker, and Docker Compose enables an automated and reproducible build and execution process for the entire system. The Android app can communicate directly with the locally deployed backend, ensuring efficient development and a functional overall workflow.
